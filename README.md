# todolist
To do list in a way of React with VanillaJS.

There are three components.

First, <Add.js> adds user's input data.

Second,<Todo.js> updates lists getting user's input data from Add.js and remove lists.

Last,<App.js> is a component for manipulating above both components, so Add.js and Todo.js are independent, reusable.

You can understand how React acts!
